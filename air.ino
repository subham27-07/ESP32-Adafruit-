  Read values of air velocity from the FS3000 sensor, print them to terminal.
  Prints raw data, m/s and mph.
  Note, the response time on the sensor is 125ms.

  Hardware Connections:
  Use a qwiic cable to connect from the Redboard Qwiic to the FS3000 breakout (QWIIC).
  You can also choose to wire up the connections using the header pins like so:

  ARDUINO --> FS3000
  SDA (A4) --> SDA
  SCL (A5) --> SCL
  3.3V --> 3.3V
  GND --> GND
